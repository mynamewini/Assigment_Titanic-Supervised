**Project Portfolio: Titanic Survival Prediction**

This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset sourced from Kaggle.com. The Titanic disaster in 1912 is a significant historical event, and analyzing the dataset provides insights into survival patterns based on various passenger characteristics such as age, gender, and class. The dataset can be accessed at link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/.

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers who were aboard the ship, including details like Passenger ID, survival status, class, age, sex, and fare. Understanding these factors can help us gain insights into the demographic influences on survival and improve future safety measures.

**Goals:**
1. Predict which passengers survived based on key features.
2. Analyze the impact of gender and class on survival rates.
3. Identify significant factors influencing survival.
4. Evaluate the performance of various classification models.
5. Provide actionable insights for enhancing safety measures in future maritime travels.

**Insights:**
1. Survival Rate by Gender: Female passengers had a higher survival rate compared to male passengers.
2. Impact of Passenger Class: Passengers in first class had the highest survival rates, while those in third class had the lowest.
3. Age Distribution: Younger passengers tended to have a higher chance of survival, especially children.
4. Model Performance: The Random Forest model outperformed other models, achieving an accuracy of 83%.
5. Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix highlighted that the model successfully identified a majority of survivors and non-survivors.

**Advice:**
1. Focus on improving safety measures for vulnerable groups, such as children and women, based on the identified survival factors.
2. Utilize insights from predictive modeling to inform training and emergency response strategies on ships.
3. Consider enhancing communication and safety protocols, especially for lower-class passengers who faced higher risks.
